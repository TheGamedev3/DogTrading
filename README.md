# Why it took so long to complete?

This project turned out much larger in scope—and took over a month to finish—because I initially misunderstood the assignment instructions. I thought I was supposed to fully recreate all the .ejs site pages like the tutorials, not just build and test routes. By the time I realized the assignment was simpler, it was too late to undo the structure I had already built. At that point, I decided to go all-in and commit to making this a complete, well-polished Express and EJS project—something I could be proud of looking back on later.
